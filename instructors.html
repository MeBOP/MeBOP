Thus var genes appear to be diversifying          much more rapidly than the rest of the genome. This process of          diversification involves frequent gene conversion events that are          initiated by DNA double strand breaks.<strong></strong><br>          <strong></strong></div>        <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Deitsch%20KW%5BAuthor%5D&amp;cauthor=true&amp;cauthor_uid=27031699">Publications</a><strong><br>        </strong>        <hr><strong><a href="https://www.unige.ch/medecine/mimo/en/groupes/773soldati-favre/g/karine-frenal/">Karine            Frenal</a><br>        </strong>        <div style="text-align: justify;">Karine Fr√©nal&nbsp; Ph.D. is a member          of the laboratory of <span>Dominique</span> <span>Soldati-Favre at            the department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine at the            University of Geneva, Switzerland.&nbsp; Her work focuses on            apicomplexan invasion mechanisms using <em>Toxoplasma</em> as a            tool. </span><br>          <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=frenal+K%5BAuthor%5D"><span>Publications</span></a>          <hr><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=frenal+K%5BAuthor%5D"><span></span><strong><b><span></span></b></strong></a><strong><a              href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oharb">Omar              S.
